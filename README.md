[ ![Codeship Status for ChristianHoj/ucn-parking](https://www.codeship.io/projects/71e74e90-a556-0130-668a-4ee1cf24b431/status?branch=master)](https://www.codeship.io/projects/3698)

Demo project for PBA Software at University College Nordjylland.
It connects to a web service at Aalborg Kommune to get information about available parking spaces.

See it in action at [Heroku] or deploy your own instance by pressing the Deploy button – you will have to set up a free Heroku account if you don't already have one.

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

You will be asked to enter the connection information supplied in the course before the deployment can take place – hints to their values are included.

The useful add-on tools for monitoring (New Relic) and load testing (Blitz) will be installed automatically with the deployment. Accounts for both will be created as well.

It will take a while to install so be patient!
